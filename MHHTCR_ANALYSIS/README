How to install:

First you have to make all installation scripts executable. Type following while in the installation folder:

chmod +x *

Then run the installation script while in the installation folder by typing:

./INSTALLPIPELINE.sh

Next you have to manually install R, VDJTOOLS and MIXCR:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: This script has been tested with R 3.4.0. Newer version may not work. To install R3.4.0 do following:

Inside the MHH_TCRAnalysis folder move into the R3.4.0 folder or download the .tar.gz from here: https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/

extract it and move into the directory from terminal. There type:

./configure --with-readline=no --with-x=no --enable-R-shlib

make

sudo make install

If there is a issue that says :  configure: error: "liblzma library and headers are required" then you probably deleted R before. 
This problem was can be avoided by leaving a different R version previously installed, like R3.5.1, on the device and still installed this. 
You can always install the latest R version with sud apt-get install r-base
