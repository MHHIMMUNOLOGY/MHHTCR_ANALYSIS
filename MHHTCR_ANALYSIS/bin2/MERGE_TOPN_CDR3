#how to look at the topN clones to find public clones

#run Extract_CDR3_from_VDJ.sh

#this will get the CDR3 AA sequence +the count

#Put them in one folder and extract the files you want to work with

#extract the topN (i.e top20)

for i in FILE*;
do
  head -n 20 $i > top20_`basename $i`
done

#This file contains the counts calculated by VDJ. Remove Count.

for i in top20*;
do
  cut -f 2 $i > AA_`basename $i`
done

#This file now might have AA sequence duplicates, as VDJ doesnt merge from AA sequence
# but NT sequence (due to wobble base, one AA might be found several times). Remove duplicates:

for i in AA_*;
do
  sort $i | uniq -c > uniq_`basename $i`
done

#This file now has one row with the count and one with the AA, again we just need the AA
# Cut the second column again, however the sort and uniq sort always add 8 spaces.
# This needs to be added to the cut command

for i in uniq_*;
do
  cut -d' ' -f 8 $i > 2_`basename $i`
done

#now we have the correct file for every sample. Put them all in one file

cat 2_* > POOLED

#now merge them again

sort POOLED | uniq -c | sort -nr > top20_POOLED_MERGED

#This is the correct file. Remove unessecary spaces added by sort, uniq command

sed 's/        //g' top20_POOLED_MERGED
